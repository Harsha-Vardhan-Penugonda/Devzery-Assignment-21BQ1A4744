   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Approach

The project is built using **React** for the frontend, leveraging **Material-UI** for UI components and **Tailwind CSS** for additional styling. The application uses **Axios** for making API requests to a mock REST API provided by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). 

The app allows users to:
- Fetch a list of users.
- Create new posts associated with a selected user.
- Retrieve and display comments for each post, demonstrating effective API chaining.

## Assumptions and Decisions Made

- **Use of Mock API**: The project uses a mock API (JSONPlaceholder) to simulate real-world API interactions, making it easier to demonstrate functionality without needing a backend.
- **Design Choice**: Material-UI was selected for its comprehensive suite of components, providing a responsive and aesthetically pleasing UI. Tailwind CSS enhances styling flexibility.
- **State Management**: Local component state management was utilized for simplicity and ease of use, suitable for the scope of this application.

## Completed Features

- Fetch users from the API and display them in a dropdown.
- Create posts associated with a selected user using a POST request.
- Fetch and display comments related to each post.
- User-friendly input fields with basic validation.
- Responsive design suitable for various screen sizes.

## Known Issues

- Comments do not persist after a page refresh; this could be enhanced with local storage or a database integration.
- Limited error handling; additional user feedback could be implemented for better UX, especially for API failures.
- The application layout may require further adjustments for optimal viewing on smaller screens.

## Future Improvements

- Implement persistent storage for comments and posts.
- Enhance error handling to provide more informative feedback to users.
- Consider adding more features such as editing and deleting posts/comments.
